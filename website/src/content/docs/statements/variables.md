title: Variables
description: These are basic types
---

Variables can be declared only at the local scope of a function as they are mutable. They are references/pointers to data.
We use the Short Variable Declaration Operator `:=` to declare a variable

```rb
low, mid, high := 0, 0, n.numItems
x := 10
y := 20
xy_list := List.of(1, 2, 3)
xy_map := Map.of(1 => "one", 2 => "two")
a := 1 + n
b := 1 * n
a * b
```
